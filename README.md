# Dog Breed Classification
This project is a part of the [Dog Breed Identification Competition](http://datascience.codeforsanfrancisco.org) at [Kaggle](http://www.codeforsanfrancisco.org).

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
Who's a good dog? Who likes ear scratches? Well, it seems those fancy deep neural networks don't have all the answers. However, maybe they can answer that ubiquitous question we all ask when meeting a four-legged stranger: what kind of good pup is that?

## Project Description
In this playground competition, you are provided a strictly canine subset of ImageNet in order to practice fine-grained image categorization. How well you can tell your Norfolk Terriers from your Norwich Terriers? With 120 breeds of dogs and a limited number training images per class, you might find the problem more, err, ruff than you anticipated.

## Getting Started

1. See this link to load datasets from kaggle [tutorial](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/06/how-to-load-kaggle-datasets-directly-into-google-colab/).
2. Raw Data is being kept [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dog-breed-identification/data) within this repo.
    
3. Data processing/Model building scripts are being kept [here](https://github.com/Khainghk/Dog-Breed-Classification.git)
